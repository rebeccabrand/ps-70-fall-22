        <h2 class="mb-4">Week 11: Visual Programming & MVP</h2>
        <p>This week's assignment was to create a minimum viable product (MVP) for our final project, making a serious attempt at one of the most challenging/intimidating aspects.
        </p>

                <h4>Testing Stepper Motors</h4>
                <p>We started by playing with different stepper motors to understand how they work. Thinking it would be sufficient for our machine, we initially programmed the <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/debanshudas23/getting-started-with-stepper-motor-28byj-48-3de8c9">28BYJ-48 stepper motor</a>
                  to move back and forth. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  However, we ended up finding a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYqx5wg4oLU">tutorial for building a CNC drawing machine</a> that would become the inspirational framework for our project.
                  Having initially thought we'd build a large frame similar to Suvin's machine, we found this person's approach to be much more agile and appropriate
                  for our creative purposes. In this example, they use NEMA 17 bipolar stepper motors for more power.

        <h4>Syringes</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p>Using a syringe was our initial idea in order to control how much solution could be deposited into the water during each print job. We developed
              a mechanism in <a href="week-9.html">Week 9</a> for a stepper motor to control the speed of a syringe pump. While this would be an
              interesting way to control liquid dispersal in small increments, it doesn't quite work for suminagashi. We think this is because the droplet
              size is too heavy or dense to float on top of the water; therefore, when the syringe drops the ink solution into the water, some of it makes a circle, but some of
              it sinks into the water itself. </p>

          <h4>Tubes</h4> 
           <p>
            Our final test used some tubing in the makerspace, though somewhat unsuccessfully. Nathan had recommended this method because it wouldn't be too
            difficult to set up a motorized pump system to highly control the liquid dispersal and avoid too muncy armature associated with the brushes or syringes. Since we haven't built a mechanism to pump liquid
            through the tube, we used a syringe to insert some of the ink and pinched the tubing so that the ink wouldn't flow immediately.
            Then, we released the pressure and let the ink drip into the water, which had a similar effect to the syringe. There was also a lot of air trapped
            in the tube that made it difficult to get all the ink out swiftly.

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Ater performing these tests, we decided that the most elegant and effective way to perform this process is to maintain
          the integrity of the original art form with brushes. Therefore, we are modeling a couple versions of brush holders than can attach
          to the y-axis of our machine. This will likely be the largest challenge of our project, since there are many precedents for building
          the x- and y-axis mechanisms of CNC drawing machines. We're exploring one option to have micro servo motors operate each brush next to one another
          and another option to have one micro servo rotating the 2 brushes to hit the water at different times.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once these mechanics are ironed out, we will decide how to provide input data to the machine to influence how many rings
          the brushes make, how long the brushes stay in the water, and other potential decisions that will influence the printmaking process. Please
          refer to <a href="https://fellyliang.github.io/PS70/index.html">Felicia's website</a> for updates on the machine prototyping from week 11.

        <h4>Building the Arm</h4>
        <p>In order to get the x-axis arm working mechanically, we performed research and collected the requisite materials, including
          toothed pulleys, timing belt, linear railing, a NEMA 17 motor, an A4988 driver and heat shield, and a 12V port and power source. 
          Initially, we laser cut and 3D-printed linear railing parts, but ended up getting the metal piece in the mail on time. 
          We also 3D-printed two base ends - one idle and one that will house the motor - as well as a raft mount for the y-axis.
          Although we anticipate the raft mount dimensions changing, it was a helpful exercise in understanding how the mount will sit upon
          and be powered by the first stepper motor.

          <h4>Bipolar Stepper Motor Setup</h4> 
           <p>
            After constructing the arm and ensuring the system works without an outside power source, we set up the stepper motor circuit
           to validate it would continue working if we programmed the motor to oscillate between clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
           We also had to solder 12v power source plug to the power and ground wires that would plug into the breadboard.

          <h4>Adding the Limit Switch</h4> 
           <p>
            Once we knew the motor moved the mount properly, we adapted different Arduino code snippets online to program the mount to travel clockwise,
            trigger the limit switch, and then travel counterclockwise back to its origin. We soldered the limit switch to power and ground wires and affixed it to the right
            edge of the mount, where it would hit the base and trigger the direction change.
