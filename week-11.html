        <h3>Testing the Ink</h3>
        <p>This week's assignment was to create a minimum viable product (MVP) for our final project, making a serious attempt at one of its most challenging/intimidating aspects. 
          Since our project will utilize some open source CNC drawing machine tutorials for the x- and y-axis movements, we decided that our MVP needed to address how the machine would deposit the 
          painting materials into the water. There is no precedent for a mechanically operated suminagashi machine, so this will be our novel addition to the catalogue of computer-aided drawing projects.
        </p>

                <h4>Brushes</h4>
                <p>We decided to first try the traditional method of suminagashi, which requires alternating using a brush with ink-surfectant-water solution and a brush with sufectant solution.
                  We angled the brushes and created several rings in the water before using the rice paper to transfer the design to its permanent setting. This was a fun exercise
                  because we hadn't actually tried this painting method yet! So we learned a lot about how to mix the solutions, position the brushes, time the brush movements, and other
                  ways to keep the entire process in sync.

        <h4>Syringes</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <p>Using a syringe was our initial idea in order to control how much solution could be deposited into the water during each print job. We developed
              a mechanism in <a href="week-9.html">Week 9</a> for a stepper motor to control the speed of a syringe pump. While this would be an
              interesting way to control liquid dispersal in small increments, it doesn't quite work for suminagashi. We think this is because the droplet
              size is too heavy or dense to float on top of the water; therefore, when the syringe drops the ink solution into the water, some of it makes a circle, but some of
              it sinks into the water itself. </p>

          <h4>Tubes</h4> 
           <p>
            Our final test used some tubing in the makerspace, though somewhat unsuccessfully. Nathan had recommended this method because it wouldn't be too
            difficult to set up a motorized pump system to highly control the liquid dispersal and avoid too muncy armature associated with the brushes or syringes. Since we haven't built a mechanism to pump liquid
            through the tube, we used a syringe to insert some of the ink and pinched the tubing so that the ink wouldn't flow immediately.
            Then, we released the pressure and let the ink drip into the water, which had a similar effect to the syringe. There was also a lot of air trapped
            in the tube that made it difficult to get all the ink out swiftly.

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Ater performing these tests, we decided that the most elegant and effective way to perform this process is to maintain
          the integrity of the original art form with brushes. Therefore, we are modeling a couple versions of brush holders than can attach
          to the y-axis of our machine. This will likely be the largest challenge of our project, since there are many precedents for building
          the x- and y-axis mechanisms of CNC drawing machines. We're exploring one option to have micro servo motors operate each brush next to one another
          and another option to have one micro servo rotating the 2 brushes to hit the water at different times.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once these mechanics are ironed out, we will decide how to provide input data to the machine to influence how many rings
          the brushes make, how long the brushes stay in the water, and other potential decisions that will influence the printmaking process.

     <h3>Building the Y-Axis</h3>
     <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>We started by prototyping the y-axis with just one brush holder. The brush is meant to be inserted into the triangular-shaped pen slider component at the front and secured using the orange finger dials. One timing belt will be connected directly to the pen holder (the larger main yellow component); the y-axis will be controlled using the stepper motor located in the raft mount (the middle green component). Another timing belt will be attached to the pen slider and controlled using a micro servo (located on the other end of the rod).

          Since we were missing a few bearings and rods, we weren't able to complete the prototype. However, it was still very helpful to set this up as we realized we had to make a few adjustments such as:
          <br>
          <br>
          - Shortening the rods to make the structure more secure
          <br>
          - Finding a better way to secure the linear rail to the two black base pieces: when the rod moved in the y-axis direction, the linear rail would rock back and forth, leading to unintentional changes in the z-height of the brush.</p>

     <h4>Remodeling the Pen Holder & Pen Slider</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          Since we need our machine to be able to hold two brushes, we started thinking about how we could incorporate this into the y-axis arm. We considered replacing the pen slider with a rotating part that could hold both brushes. We could control the rotation to dip one brush into the water bed at a time. However, we realized that this may be difficult to calibrate because the brush might move the ink as it moves in/out of the water, which wouldn't create the desired effect.
