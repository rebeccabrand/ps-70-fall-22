                <h4>Milling Topography in Wood</h4>
                <p>I prepared 2 files last week with the objectives of practicing milling wood on the ShopBot and practicing milling wax on the SRM machine.
                  First, I knew I wanted to mill a topographic map of Mount Kenya for a friend, so I researched tutorials for translating a digital elevation model (DEM)
                  to an STL file that would be compatible with the CNC machines at our disposal.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I discovered a website called Terrain2STL that allows you to input latitude and longitude coordinates and export an STL model of your chosen terrain. Amazing!
                  Then, I found a tutorial on how to clean the terrain STL in blender and finalize the geometry in Fusion360. I've embedded screenshots of my process below.

            <h5>Getting the Material Ready</h5>
            <p>Although I had only practiced using the ShopBot with the OSB, I didn't want to use that material for my design. In addition, the process of milling the topography would
              inevitably be more complex than the simple example we were given in class. Ibrahim had suggested I use 2 pieces of plywood glued togethger to give the elevation more depth. 
              I attached the pieces I found with wood glue and clamped them to a table in SC102 overnight. On Tuesday, Ibrahim helped me set up the file for the ShopBot.
              The tutorial I found had suggested I prep the file in Fusion360 for milling, but we used Aspire instead.

            <h4>Wax and its Discontents</h4>
            <p>I will preface this section with the fact that I had a bunch of trouble with the SRM machine; Kassia was really gracious and helpful with troubleshooting,
              but when we finally got my milling job to work, the outcome was pretty mediocre. My initial idea was to mill a wax mold of mushrooms of different sizes. I wanted to use that mold to 
              create a food-safe silicone mold in which I would cast mushrooms out of chocolate, or even better, truffle butter. 
              
              Initially, I thought I would just do a 2.5D profile of my mushrooms, so I prepped my Fusion360 file to reflect that direction (3 mushrooms flattened within a box). However, I followed Ibrahim's suggestion during lab to include small 
              columns for each mushroom: one would become the channel for the silicone solution, and one channel would be for air to escape the mold as to avoid air bubbles. Then, I made 2 versions of my file with pegs and holes
              that could theoretically lock together, making a fully 3D mold that would round out the mushroom shape. On to milling!

            <h5>Troubleshooting with SRM-20</h5>
            <p>I thought I had been oh so proactive by trying to mill my mold on Friday afternoon, but ended up encountering very many struggles with the machine.
              First, I did a rough pass using the 2.5D STL settings, which the website suggested. This came out okay, but the print probably took
              a full 1/1.5 hour(s) and created a comically large amount of wax dust inside the machine. I noticed that the rought cut didn't make a dent in my smallest mushroom or the columns below, which I attribute to using too large of a drill bit (1/8 inch). However,
              I wanted to see the whole print through and decided to set up the finishing pass.

        <br>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <h5>Epic Fail</h5>
            <p>For the finishing pass, I swapped the drill bit for 1/16 inch and adjusted the workflow for the 3D STL. Kassia and I encountered an error where
              the milling job would just fail within the first 10 seconds of the print, which we fixed by adjusting the Z-height of the bit higher. The rest 
              of the print went fine; however, when I went to get my block from the interior space, it wasn't totally refined and a bunch of wax dust was caked to the bottom.
              No one knew how this had happened, and because the jobs had taken so long, I walked away from the SRM-20 both defeated and galvanized to pursue another option. Overall, I think it would have been much easier to cut something with a 2D profile (like the cartoon example) rather than something with smooth, curved geometry.
              It's my hunch that there wa tension between the level of shape fidelity and what the machine was capable of doing with the settings I had.

            <h5>Pivoting to a 3D-printed mold</h5>
            <p>Luckily enough, I had 2 ready-to-print STL files. I set them up on the Prusa and let them print overnight. I made a couple slight adjustments to
              the design that I hadn't done for the wax process, so there was a silver lining to all of this.
