                <h4>Photogrammetry</h4>
                <p>After watching several tutorials on Meshroom, I noticed that the software wasn't compatible with Mac iOS.
                    My friend suggested using polycam, a popular 3D capture app for iPhone.
                    I started with this because I'm always curious about products that make seemingly complex technologies
                    more readily accessible to the layperson. The ability to 3D-scan objects from your phone, and then clean
                    and print those objects for artistic or industrial uses, feels like it could open up a lot of creative
                    opportunities for people working or learning across sectors.

                <h5>Scanning My Shoes</h5>
                <p>I chose to <b>scan my chunky New Balance sneakers</b> because I felt that these would be difficult to model in Fusion360.
                    They have multiple colors, textures, and shapes along the body and upper of each shoe. However, I know that shoe design is a common use case for 3D modeling and printing, so I'd be interested to explore
                    this area in more detail this week. The polycam app has 2 options: "LiDAR" and "PHOTO" - their FAQ explains that
                    the LiDAR setting is better for scanning a large space, like a room or apartment, and PHOTO is better for smaller, discrete objects.
                    I decided to try both for this exercise to better understand their strengths and limitations.

                <h5>LiDAR vs. Photo Results</h5>
                <p>The LiDAR workflow had me take a video surrounding the shoes and took maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute to process.
                            The results were obviously less refined, with less detail around the base of the shoe. The PHOTO workflow had me take multiple photos from
                            different angles, which took several minutes to process. However, this reproduction was much cleaner
                            than the LiDAR one, which validates polycam's suggestion from the start. I found it interesting that the methods
                            processed different radii from the shoes themselves (as the videos show below), and I wonder whether this has to do with
                            the LiDAR method being better suited to spatial environments.
